Classes are a way to create a ton of objects
They use the start of class nameOfClass {}
They have constructor functions that setup all of the inputs they will take
You can still use dot notation on the objects you create from the classes with OOP
When we're extending any of the classes, we are going to take in all of the functionality of the class it's inheriting.
